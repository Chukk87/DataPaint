# Data Paint

Data Paint is a project designed to build reports dynamicaly whilst managing the security and user access.

## Description

Data Paint builds output reports based on expected input data and orientation templates. Input data can be of many types such as excel data, csv files, delimiter files, sql tables or apis. Orientation sets ups (The process which collects the input files and ouutput parameters) can be managed by Group Owners where changes and adhoc runs can go through an authorisation process. To control the visibility of confidential data users can be assigned to security groups to control the visibility of the data. 

The application can either be hosted on an ISS web server or a desktop application.
